This project was about gender inclsuive language. 
We provide several example sentences of gendered language, 
and allow users to drag and drop parts of the sentence to edit it.
The goal is to edit the sentences to remove gendered language.
Users can do this in several ways, which we rank as being "ok" or "good".
This site could be used in an English class to help students learn about gendered language.
It could be expanded upon to add an interface for teachers to create their own sentences on the site.
